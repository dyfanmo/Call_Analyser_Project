 Good morning, thank you for calling the Ghost Office, the most-isperated postal service. My name is Anna, how can I assist you today? Before we proceed, I need to inform you that this call is being recorded. We may contact you in the future to offer future products and services. You can always have the option to withdraw from receiving this contact from us. Now, how can I help you today? Hi Anna, my name is Bob. I'm calling because I've been tracking a parcel that was supposed to be delivered to me three days ago. But the status hasn't updated since it was out of delivery. Can you help me with that? Of course Bob, I'd be happy to assist you with your parcel issue. Could you please provide me with the tracking number? Sure, it's GH123456789. Thank you Bob, give me just a moment to look at the details on your parcel. Thank you for the patience Bob, I've located your parcel in our system. It appears that there was a slight delay due to an unexpected reroute in the delivery process. However, I can confirm that your parcel is on the move again and should be delivered to you by the end of the day tomorrow. Oh, that's a relief to hear. Is there any way I can get updates so I don't miss the delivery? Absolutely Bob, I can send you up for SMS notifications. You receive updates directly to your phone about your parcel's journey and a specific time window for the delivery tomorrow. Would that work for you? Oh, yes, that would be perfect. Thank you Anna. You're very welcome Bob. I send you up for SMS notifications. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No, that was everything. You've been a great help Anna. Thank you so much. It was my pleasure to assist you Bob. If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to call us back at ghost office. Have a great day and look forward to your parcel arriving tomorrow. We'll do Anna. Thanks again and have a great day too. Good day.
