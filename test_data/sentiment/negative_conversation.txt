 Good morning, thank you for calling the ghost office. My name is Anna, how may I assist you today? Hi Anna, this is Bob. I've got a concern about my parcel that I believe has been stolen. I'm so sorry to hear that Bob. I'll do my best to help. Please, before we proceed, I need to inform you that this coin is being recorded. We may contact you in future to offer future products and services. You always have the option to withdraw from receiving this contact from us. Do you agree? Yeah, sure, whatever. Just help me with my parcel. Thank you for understanding Bob. I'm sorry to hear about the stolen parcel. So, assist you better. Could you please provide me with a tracking number or any relevant details about the shipment? Yeah, it's XYZ123456. Thank you for providing that, Bob. I've checked the tracking information for XYZ123456. According to our records, the parcel was successfully delivered to be provided to the provided address today. The delivery status indicates that it was received by the resident. That's impossible. I never received anything. I understand this is concerning, Bob. However, as per our records, the parcel was delivered successfully. If you believe there's been a mistake, I recommend checking with the neighbors or verify in the delivery address. Additionally, you may want to contact your local authorities to report the incident. This is ridiculous. What's the point of using the post office if my parcels get stolen? I empathize with your frustration, Bob. Our primary responsibility is ensuring secure and timely deliveries. Unfortunately, once the parcel has been marked as delivery, our options are very limited. I recommend taking the steps I mentioned earlier to investigate further. If there's anything I can assist you with, please let me know. Whatever, I don't care. I'll figure it out myself. I'm sorry I would clear them, but provide a more positive resolution, Bob. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach us out. Thank you for choosing ghost office. Have a good day.
